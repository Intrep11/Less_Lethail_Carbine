# Less_Lethail_Carbine
How does it work  This script works by entering the /lesslethal command in your chat this will then enable less lethal bullets that can be turned off by re entering the command  When enables the script will make it so your bullets now dont do any damage but make the player that has been shot ragdoll, this can be used with Civ's and LEO's
